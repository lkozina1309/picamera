# Picamera
Raspberry Pi camera scripts in python.

## Getting Started
Python-picamera combined with OpenCV so you can make usage of Computer Vision techniques while streaming in real-time. Repository includes few simple scripts for circle, face and eye detection as well as motion detection and for making photos during stream.

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.7–3.9
Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi camera
Python-picamera
OpenCV
matplolib
```
### Description
Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. The original model became more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring, because of its low cost, modularity, and open design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of HDMI and USB devices. 

The camera board is shipped with a flexible flat cable that plugs into the CSI connector which is located between the Ethernet and HDMI ports. In Raspbian, the user must enable the use of the camera board by running Raspi-config and selecting the camera option. It uses the OmniVision OV5647 image sensor and can produce 1080p, 720p and 640x480p video. The dimensions are 25 mm × 20 mm × 9 mm. Python-picamera is a library
