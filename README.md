### Description
Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers. The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. The original model became more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring, because of its low cost, modularity, and open design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of HDMI and USB devices. 

Python-picamera combined with OpenCV so you can make usage of Computer Vision techniques while streaming in real-time. Repository includes few simple scripts for circle, face and eye detection as well as motion detection and for making photos during stream.
